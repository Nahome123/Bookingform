It’s home to charming pubs, world-class (and often free) museums, tons of history, some of the best theater in the world, a diverse population, incredible food, and a wild nightlife.
                              I know it’s cliched to say there’s something for everyone but, in this sprawling metropolis, there really is.
                              I’ve been visiting London since 2008 and, with every subsequent visit, the city has grown on me. The more I go, the more awesome stuff I see, the more I fall in love with it. There’s always something new to do here and there’s an energetic vibe to the city. </h4></p></b>
